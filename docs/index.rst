Welcome to tsdate's documentation!
==================================

``Tsdate`` is a scalable method for estimating times in the past for ancestral 
nodes in a :ref:`tree sequence <sec_python_api>`, in other words, *dating* a 
tree sequence. It assumes a prior distribution of node times given by neutral
coalescent theory, and updates the times on the basis of the number of mutations
along each edge or branch of the tree sequence (i.e. using the "molecular clock").
